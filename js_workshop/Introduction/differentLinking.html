    <!--Example 1, the Console Tag-->
    <!--
        Load up Google Chrome (majority of browsers have this, we use chrome to
        keep things simple.

        Top-Right corner, three dots. Find "More Tools," which should open a sidebar
        up. Then, click "Developer Tools." Then, navigate to the Console tab.

        Tip: If this does not work, we can also do these methods
        1.) Right click the page we are on, then select "Inspect"
        2.) For ease of access, do CTRL + Shift + I (if on Mac, CMD + SHIFT + I)

        Now, type in the following:
            console.log("Hello World!")
        - console.log is a method that writes to the console. Each web page will
          have this. Good for debugging.
        - Can now also do basic operations/coding.
    -->

    <!--Example 2, script tag-->
    <script class="ex-2" type="________">

    </script>
    <!--
        Take a look at the script tag above, with the class titled "ex-2."
        This is the second way we can inject JavaScript into a web page.
        Instead of the underscores, insert "type/javascript" into it.

        1.) Notice how, if we are using a code editor, the underlines go away.
            we are essentially telling the html document that this code is 
            JavaScript.
        2.) Similar to before in the console.log example, let's type:
                console.log("Hello world!")
            Place this between the angular brackets (these things: <> [INSERT HERE] <>)
        3.) Open up the web page, and then open up the console using the
            methods above.

        We are now "storing" JavaScript code inside an html document, and this
        JavaScript will ALWAYS run if we open the html document. Now, let's add
        the following lines of code within that angular brackets (we can delete
        the console.log is necessary as well):
            console.log(Date.now())
        
        Refresh the page now. Cool!

        Main point of JavaScript: dynamic and interactive language. The page
        is updating by itself without having to manually change things!

        Once we are done, comment out the above script tag or just delete it.
    -->

    <!--Example 3, src attribute-->
    <script class="ex-3" src="[_______]"></script>
    <!--
        Look at the above example. This time, we don't have the text attribute before.
        Look inside the folder examples. Notice the file called "app.js." Type this
        into the [_____] area, between the quotation marks:
            "./app.js"

        Open up app.js as well.

        Now, open up this HTML page.

        We should see nothing at first, right? Open up the console again and look
        at the message.

        We're running JavaScript code externally! It's not even explicitly written
        in the HTML code!

        So, it's like linking an external stylesheet in CSS. This is incredibly
        important, since this is how we can manage our code without it becoming a
        jumbled mess.

        Where do we store this script/src tag? Good practice says <head> tag.
        Treat it like we are linking an external stylesheet.
