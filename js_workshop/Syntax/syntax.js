 * Instructor note: this page should be left blank, but we will have notes here.
 * 
 * Exercise 1: Variables and Boxes
 * Give introduction of Variables, as well as a quick recap since the students 
 * should have a somewhat decent grasp of it already.
 * 
 * Demo:
 * var x = 10;
 * console.log(x);
 * x = 20;
 * console.log(x);
 * 
 * Make them type this out, look at the results. We can refer to pieces of data 
 * not explicitly of course! This is a PRIMITIVE.
 * 
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Exercise 1.1: Keyword Declarations
 * Let the students type out "let" vs "var" vs "const." An example:
 * 
 * let x = 20;
 * var y = 25;
 * const z = 30;
 * 
 * console.log(x);
 * console.log(y);
 * console.log(z);
 * 
 * Notice how these all work in terms of declaring a variable. Don't go into too
 * much detail, since this is extremely confusing and to be honest I personally
 * don't know the exact specifics either. Just point out how these do exist and
 * mention how const means that we can no longer change the value stored (do a
 * z = 34958903? show it doesn't work). 
 * 
 * Stick with var.
